# Singleton Pattern â€“ Java Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project demonstrates the Singleton Design Pattern in Java. The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

## ðŸ“‚ File
- `SingletonExample.java`: Contains the implementation and testing of the Singleton pattern.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- **Private Constructor**: Prevents instantiation from outside the class.
- **Static Instance**: Holds the single object of the class.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Instance is created only when it's needed.
- **Global Access Point**: `getInstance()` method provides access to the single instance.
