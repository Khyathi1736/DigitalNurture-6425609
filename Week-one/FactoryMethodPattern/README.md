# Factory Method Pattern â€“ Simple Shape Example

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project shows a simple implementation of the Factory Method Pattern using basic shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Square). The factory method creates the correct shape object based on user input.

## ðŸ“‚ File
- `ShapeFactoryDemo.java`: Contains all interface, concrete shape classes, factory, and main method.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- **Factory Pattern**: Delegates object creation to a method based on input.
- **Abstraction**: The client uses a common `Shape` interface without knowing specific class types.
